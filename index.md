This week I've reviewed two papers:
- The Neural Bases of the Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Frame of Reference, Zaehle et al., 2007
- Manipulation of 3D Objects in Immersive Virutal Environments, Mendes et al., 2016

##### The Neural Bases of the Egocentric and Allocentric Spatial Frame of Reference
This artical discusses the effect that spacial movements have on the brain, and what part of the brain. What is important to distinguish in an application is its Frame of Reference (FoR) - either egocentric, where the objects in a space are represented in reference to oneself, or allocentric, where the objects in a space are represented independent of onself and in reference to each other. Based on how these environments are set up, neuronal circuits in spacial cognition are affected. The study described used "verbal descriptions of spatial relations", either in repect to the listener for egocentric testing, or without reference to the listener for allocentric testing, in order to see the areas of the brain affected. 

>"By using exclusively verbal descriptions we provide strong evidence that spatial processing requires primary visual cortex functions, which reflect mental imagery processing. The results of this study show that egocentric and allocentric spatial coding are partly unique domains which recruit distinct brain regions"

In building the Hyperion application on a new platform it is important to consider chosing the right frame of reference, either egocentric or allocentric, because of how differently they affect the user's congnition. 

##### Manipulation of 3D Objects in Immersive Virutal Environments

This week I worked on creating the function specifications, specifically for functions that would be useful in 3D interactions. Functions like selection, translation, rotation, and scaling are important to locate in the backend in order to find what is needed for manipulation in the front end.
